  <p>Beacons are devices that use the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol to
repeatedly send short transmissions, called advertisements, to mobile
devices or other Bluetooth scanning device. Advertisements can contain
an identifier and/or sensor data and the brevity of these advertisements
allows for battery operated use lasting several years.</p>
<p>In their simplest form, beacons can be used to pinpoint your location.
At their most complex, beacons can transmit and receive data from
sensors and other beacons. Beacons enable (but are not limited to) the
following use cases:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>triggering relevant mobile content for education and shopping
experiences</li>
<li>initiating data transfer between a mobile device and usb or OEM
beacon at point of sale computer to redeem offers</li>
<li>logging and reporting temperature data</li>
<li>notifying a quick service restaurant of your arrival for order pickup</li>
<li>tracking the location of assets in real time</li>
<li>Beacons are essentially broadcasters of data. This data can be
static, such as an identifier, public or obfuscated, or data from
sensors.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Getting Started With Your Project<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started-with-your-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Ready to go with your beacon project? Start here for everything you need
to get up and running:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Choose the right beacon for your project<ul>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.bluecats.com/aa-bluetooth-beacon/">AA Beacon</a> Our
most popular beacon. Longest battery life and full Eddystone EID
support with dust and weather resistant options.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.bluecats.com/usb-beacon/">USB Beacon</a>. More than a
beacon. Scan for beacons nearby and two-way communication between
a mobile device and host of BLE via the USB beacon</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.bluecats.com/coin-mobile-beacon/">Coin Beacon</a>.
Compact and powerful. Supports all available Eddystone, iBeacon
and BlueCats advertisement specifications with replaceable coin
cell battery.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.bluecats.com/bc010-ibeacon/">BC010 BLE Module</a>.
The BC010 can be connected directly to a battery or SMT soldered
to a host PCB and is ideal for data logging from BlueCats Sensor
Boards while the rest of the system is in sleep mode. The module
is perfect for application where battery life, small form factor,
RF performance and speed to market are important.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a BlueCats account and claim your beacons with the the
<a class="reference external" href="https://app.bluecats.com/">BlueCats Web App</a>, download the BC
Reveal app, which is our management app on
<a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bluecats.bcreveal&amp;hl=en">Android</a>
or
<a class="reference external" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bc-reveal/id852676494?mt=8">iOS</a></li>
<li>Choose an advertisement format and configure your beacons with the BC
Reveal app</li>
<li>Every beacon project is different. Choose your beacon configuration
and tools and start building: Install the BlueCats SDK or iOS or
Android into your mobile app to enable cross-platform proximity
detection and analytics Use your beacons with any iBeacon compatible
application or library No app? Eddystone-URL and the Physical Web</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="supported-beacon-specifications">
<h1>Supported Beacon Specifications<a class="headerlink" href="#supported-beacon-specifications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>BlueCats beacon hardware and Platform provide complete flexibility to
choose a beacon format best suited to your application. With BlueCats
beacons you can support any of the following open or BlueCats
proprietary specifications:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/">iBeacon</a> – Apple’s release
of the iBeacon BLE specification and deep native support in 2014
brought beacon technology to the main stream. Still the best choice
for many consumer mobile app use cases where support for both iOS and
Android devices is required.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/beacons/eddystone">Eddystone</a> –
Eddystone is an open beacon format developed by Google and designed
with transparency and robustness in mind. Eddystone can be detected
by both Android and iOS.<ul>
<li>Eddystone-UID,</li>
<li>Eddytone-URL (or Physical Web)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>BlueCats Platform - need to do something not supported by the open
beacon protocols? BlueCats have a range of advertisements and BLE
libraries to fill the gaps and extend the capabilities of a Bluetooth
beacon network.<ul>
<li>BlueCats Secure</li>
<li>Sensor</li>
<li>Data Transfer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="edge-relay">
<h1>Edge Relay<a class="headerlink" href="#edge-relay" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Edge Relay is a customisable gateway that allows you to scan for BLE
(Bluetooth Low Energy) traffic and send that data to different
endpoints. Capture all of your Bluetooth devices in range using the
popular formats: iBeacon, Eddystone, and our custom beacons. Control the
flow of your data using signal smoothing, filtering, and throttling to
get exactly the data you need. Once you have your data, you can
communicate it to your endpoints using UDP or MQTT protocols.</p>
