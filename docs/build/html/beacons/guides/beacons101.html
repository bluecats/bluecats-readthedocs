<h1>What is a beacon?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-beacon" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Beacons are devices that use the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol to
repeatedly send short transmissions, called advertisements, to mobile
devices and other. Advertisements can contain identifier and/or sensor
data and the brevity of these advertisements allows for battery operated
use lasting several years.</p>

<h1>What can I do with beacons? (Why Beacons?)<a class="headerlink" href="#what-can-i-do-with-beacons-why-beacons" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In their simplest form, beacons can be used to pinpoint your location.
At their most complex, beacons can transmit and receive data from
sensors and other beacons. Beacons enable (but are not limited to) the
following use cases: * triggering relevant mobile content for education
and shopping experiences * initiating data transfer between a mobile
device, beacon and point of sale computer to redeem offers * logging
and reporting temperature data * notifying a quick service restaurant
of your arrival for order pickup * tracking the location of assets in
real time</p>
<p>Beacons are essentially broadcasters of data. This data can be static,
such as an identifier, public or obfuscated, or data from sensors or
devices such as order ID. We have several real world uses in the case
study section of our <a class="reference external" href="http://bluecats.com/case-study.html">website</a>.</p>
<p>Choose the right beacon for your project:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.bluecats.com/aa-beacon/">AA Beacon</a> Our most popular
beacon. Longest battery life and supports Eddystone, iBeacon and
BlueCats advertisement specifications with dust and weather resistant
options. AA and Coin Beacon are functionally the same unit. They
utilize the BC010 module and have an average range of 100-200 meters.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.bluecats.com/coin-beacon/">Coin Beacon</a>. Compact and
powerful. Supports all available Eddystone, iBeacon and BlueCats
advertisement specifications with replaceable coin cell battery. AA
and Coin Beacon are functionally the same unit. They utilize the
BC010 module and have an average range of 100-200 meters.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.bluecats.com/usb-beacon/">USB Beacon</a>. More than a
beacon. Scan for beacons nearby and two-way communication between a
mobile device and host of BLE via the USB beacon</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.bluecats.com/bc010/">BC010 BLE Module</a>. The BC010 can
be connected directly to a battery or SMT soldered to a host PCB and
is ideal for data logging from BlueCats Sensor Boards while the rest
of the system is in sleep mode. The module is perfect for application
where battery life, small form factor, RF performance and speed to
market are important.</li>

<h2>What’s BLE, iBeacon, Eddystone?<a class="headerlink" href="#whats-ble-ibeacon-eddystone" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a power friendly version of Bluetooth.
Built from the beginning to enable the Internet of Things, BLE is power
efficient and extensible to diverse use cases. These goals are achieved
by short, customizable transmissions that are sent from BLE enabled
devices.</p>
<p><strong>iBeacon</strong> is a BLE advertisement format defined by Apple that enables
iOS applications, open or closed, to be notified when particular beacon
ranging events occur. This is most important when you wish to deliver
context to a customer even when their application is closed or
backgrounded.</p>
<p><strong>Eddystone</strong> is a collection of open beacon formats created by Google.
These formats include the following: * Eddystone-UID: for sending
static beacon identifier information * Eddystone-URL: for sending a
short URL to surrounding devices and can be leveraged by mobile devices
using the Chrome app * Eddystone-TLM: for sending beacon health
information to monitor the health of beacons * Eddystone-EID: for
sending encoded beacon identifier information for secure beacon use</p>

<div class="section" id="how-granular-can-i-be">
<h2>How granular can I be?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-granular-can-i-be" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Beacons operate as reference points. The more reference points you add,
the more granular you can become. Accompanied by the BlueCatsSDKs and
BlueCats know-how, applications and devices can define triggers that
single out the nearest beacon and trigger the appropriate event. You can
even be as granular as defining an interaction to the near tapping of a
phone or tablet on a beacon.</p>

<h2>What Makes Bluetooth Low Energy Different from traditional Bluetooth?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-makes-bluetooth-low-energy-different-from-traditional-bluetooth" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bluetooth Low Energy uses a new framework for device connectivity that
is ultra-power efficient and requires no pairing.</p>
<p>In addition, simply having Bluetooth turned on in your phone settings
doesn’t mean it will drain battery when not paired to your favorite
headset or car stereo. When not paired, Bluetooth is passive and scans
for connectable devices in a decaying time period. As time passes, the
scan for my previously paired devices interval grows to a longer and
longer period up to a defined maximum which differs by platform.</p>
