Overview
--------

BlueCats beacons have a special ability to transfer data to and from
your app and optionally a host (USB beacons). This is particularly
useful if you would like to perform some sort of transaction, receive
data from a host computer, or transfer data between two phones using a
beacon as an intermediary.
