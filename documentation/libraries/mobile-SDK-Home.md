## Overview

The BlueCats platform includes everything you need to add spatial intelligence to your application and manage beacons at scale. Our goal is to enable smart devices to achieve spatial intelligence with the least amount of development. Install our SDKs for Android and iOS with just a few lines of code and remote configuration, beacon visit logging and a framework for scalable beacon interaction is at your fingertips.
